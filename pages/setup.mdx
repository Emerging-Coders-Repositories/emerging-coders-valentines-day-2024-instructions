# Setup

Ideally, we are assuming that you have already installed Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension for VS code. If not, you can download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the Live Server extension from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

If you don't want to go through that process, then you can use the following Replit link to run the code in your browser: [Run on Replit](https://replit.com/@ethanpaneraa/Emerging-Coders-Valentines-Day-2024#index.html). You're going to want to press on the green button that says "Fork and Run" and login into your account if needed. 

# Setting Up on Visual Studio Code

## Installing Visual Studio Code and Live Server
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Click on the Extensions icon on the left side of the screen
3. Search for "Live Server" and click on the first result
4. Click on the green "Install" button
5. Once installed, click on the "Reload" button to reload the window

## Creating the Files
1. Create a new folder on your desktop and name it "Valentines Day 2024"
2. Inside the folder, create a new file and name it "index.html" You're going to want to paste the following HTML into the file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Emerging Coders Valentines Day Event</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="main-container">
        <!-- TODO: Add the title of the webpage, an image, and a message here -->
    </div>
    <div class="button-container">
        <!-- TODO: Add the Yes and No buttons here -->
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
3. Next, create another file and name it "style.css". For now, you can leave it empty. 
4. Next, create another file and name it "script.js". For now, you can leave it empty as well. 

This is the basis of the setup. You can add more files if you want, but there are the only files that we need to create for this project.
