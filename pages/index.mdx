# Introduction
 
Welcome to the **Emerging Coders Valentines Workshop** where we will be creating a fun and cute Valentines day card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This workshop is deigned for beginners and will be a great way to learn some real basics of web development. 

More specifically, we will be creating a sort "gag" gift for your _special someone_ using a simple web page.
